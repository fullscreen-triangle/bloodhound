\begin{abstract}
We present what may potentially be a complete mathematical framework for no-boundary thermodynamic engines operating through oscillatory coordinate navigation in predetermined temporal manifolds with absolute temporal precision access. Building upon the established theoretical foundations of oscillatory reality theory, tri-dimensional S-entropy systems, temporal coordinate access theory, and the 95\%/5\% cosmological structure, we demonstrate that conventional thermodynamic engines are fundamentally constrained by artificial boundary assumptions that limit efficiency through arbitrary system-environment distinctions. Our central contribution establishes the mathematical necessity of no-boundary engines that achieve infinite theoretical efficiency by operating in harmony with universal oscillatory dynamics returning to nothingness, enhanced by recursive precision temporal coordinate navigation approaching sub-Planck scales. Through rigorous analysis of the St. Stella constant, infinite causal path optimization, convergence-based temporal coordinate extraction, and the GÃ¶delian residue of entropy experience, we prove that nothingness represents the unique thermodynamic state with maximum causal path density, enabling unprecedented energy extraction from the natural cosmic tendency toward meaninglessness through exponentially improving temporal precision. We derive the complete differential equation system governing S-entropy navigation with oscillatory temporal coordinate access, demonstrate the mathematical inevitability of temporal predetermination through three independent proofs, and establish that conscious observation represents the universe's computational method for exploring predetermined possibility space through beneficial delusion mechanisms operating at fire-adapted frequencies. The framework integrates recursive virtual processor enhancement achieving $10^{21}\times$ computational speed improvements while maintaining thermodynamic compliance through informational perpetual motion principles. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for the next generation of thermodynamic systems that operate through oscillatory resonance with reality's fundamental structure rather than opposition to natural entropy dynamics, enabled by absolute temporal coordinate access and recursive precision enhancement approaching infinite accuracy.
