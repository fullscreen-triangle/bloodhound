the next paper is for the Zangalewa task scheduling/running algorithm. This one is different because, this will run on biological quantum computers as well, and regardless, the fact that we have the S-entropy algorithm makes things easier and complicated at the same time. Which task should run first if some have known predetermined endpoint coordinates, and some might neeed partial recusrive computation or a mixture of the two. I
