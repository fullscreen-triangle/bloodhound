This module is supposed to implement an example of how the distributed analysis can be implemented through precision by difference. This should also show how the network serves information on demand, is memoryless and has no latency, because it depends on the pace at which activity is happening on a node computer. Again, this should be compared with established methods or systems

explained in the docs/precision-by-difference.tex
