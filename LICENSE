CONSCIOUSNESS-AWARE COMPUTING LICENSE ADDENDUM

This software implements consciousness-aware virtual machine technology based on
theoretical frameworks developed by Kundai Farai Sachikonye. The following 
additional terms apply specifically to the consciousness-related components:

1. S-ENTROPY NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY
   The S-entropy navigation algorithms and tri-dimensional coordinate systems
   implemented in this software are based on original research. Users are
   encouraged to cite the relevant scientific papers when using this technology
   in academic or research contexts.

2. BIOLOGICAL MAXWELL DEMON IMPLEMENTATIONS
   The consciousness processing components that implement Biological Maxwell
   Demon frame selection are experimental technologies. Users should validate
   results independently and understand the theoretical nature of these systems.

3. PURPOSE FRAMEWORK AND COMBINE HARVESTER
   The domain-specific learning and knowledge integration frameworks are provided
   as implementations of research concepts. Users are responsible for ensuring
   appropriate use in their specific domains and compliance with relevant
   regulations.

4. SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY
   While this software aims to provide scientifically accurate computations,
   users are responsible for validating results, especially in critical
   applications such as medical diagnosis, legal analysis, or financial decisions.

5. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
   This software is primarily intended for research and development purposes.
   Production use should be approached with appropriate caution and testing.

6. ATTRIBUTION
   Users who publish research or applications based on this software are
   encouraged to cite the relevant publications and acknowledge the theoretical
   foundations developed by the author.

7. EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
   Features marked as "experimental" (including meta-consciousness, quantum
   S-entropy, and self-modifying consciousness) are theoretical implementations
   that should be used only for research purposes.

The consciousness-aware computing components of this software represent novel
approaches to computation and artificial intelligence. Users should approach
these technologies with appropriate scientific rigor and understanding of
their experimental nature.
