# tracker — repo-federation tracker

A Rust CLI that tracks a **group of repositories and their conserved sense/goal** —
not just commits, but *what each repo is fundamentally about* and whether that has
moved. Built for a research group with many repos.

It is one of three composable, per-project-installable tools; it reimplements
neither of the other two:

| Organ | Tool | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Search** | [`purpose`](../../../semantics/purpose) | Answers "what/where/sense" by *searching, not fetching*. |
| **Execution** | network-yield CLI *(in development)* | Runs specific repo code in the cloud (Codespaces / cloud compute). |
| **Tracking** | **`tracker`** (this tool) | Federates repos, holds each repo's invariant χ, coordinates the agents. |

Design doc: [`../docs/tracker/repo-federation-tracker-design.md`](../docs/tracker/repo-federation-tracker-design.md).

## What "sense/goal" means: χ, the character invariant

A repo is a finite weighted graph (its files/sections, joined by containment and
cross-reference). Its **character invariant χ** is the *minimum cut-residual* — the
least-cost way to split it into unrelated pieces, in the currency of its own
structure. χ is:

- **positive** (a repo with structure has a non-collapsible sense),
- **conserved** under relabelling (renaming files/symbols doesn't change it), and
- **non-local** (it names a *region* that most cheaply severs, never one file).

χ is computed over the repo's **largest connected component** (its principal body of
work) and the number of disconnected **fragments** is reported alongside — a repo's
raw index is naturally split between, e.g., docs and code, and that split is a fact
worth surfacing, not hiding.

χ is *cached only as a change-detector*. Every actual answer is produced by a fresh
`purpose ask` against the current index — the tool never serves a stored summary
(the "search-not-fetch" discipline).

## Install

```bash
cd thrust/tracker
cargo install --path .
```

Requires the `purpose` CLI on PATH (`purpose --version`). Execution (`run`) also
requires the network-yield CLI once its interface is finalised; until then the tool
is a full read-only tracker/search federation and `run` degrades gracefully.

## Use

```bash
tracker init                       # create the federation here (.tracker/)
tracker add ../my-repo             # register a repo; indexes it via `purpose`
tracker add ../other --name lib    # …with an explicit name
tracker list                       # repos, current χ, committed count m

tracker sense my-repo              # the repo's standing sense/goal (χ + salient files)
tracker sense my-repo "where is the parser"   # fresh search within one repo
tracker ask "S-entropy coordinate"            # search across the whole federation

tracker drift my-repo              # recompute χ; report whether the sense has moved
tracker run my-repo "run tests"    # hand a goal to the execution organ (when wired)
```

## Using it from anywhere: scripts, other programs, AI agents

Everything the tool can answer or do is one registry of named operations. Each is
a **question** (reads) or an **action** (changes a repo, the federation or an
origin), takes a JSON object and returns one. There are three ways in, all
reaching the same code:

| Caller | Entry point |
|---|---|
| a script, CI job, or any program | `tracker describe`, `tracker call <op> '<json>'` |
| an AI agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, any MCP client) | `tracker mcp` |
| a Rust crate | `tracker::api::call(op, json)` / `tracker::api::ops()` |

**Install** once per machine; it then works from any directory:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound tracker
# or, from a checkout:  cargo install --path thrust/tracker
```

**Programs.** `tracker describe` lists every operation with its kind, whether it
touches the network, and its JSON Schema. `tracker call` runs one and prints JSON.
A failure prints `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}` and exits
non-zero. Codes are stable, so callers can branch on them.

```bash
tracker call sync_visibility '{"paths": ["bitspark/pricing.md"]}'
tracker call sync_hide '{"pattern": "bitspark/", "label": "bitspark"}'
tracker call sync_status '{"repo": "bloodhound"}'
echo '{"question": "entropy"}' | tracker call federation_ask -
```

**AI agents.** `tracker mcp` serves every operation as an MCP tool over stdio.
Questions are marked read-only. Actions that reach origins are marked open-world,
so the client can ask before running them. To give an agent working in some other
project the tool, add to that project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "tracker": { "command": "tracker", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

The server treats the directory it starts in as the current repo (override with
`--root <dir>`). Any operation also accepts `"repo"`: a path, or the name of a repo
tracked in the federation. A federation found by walking up from the current
directory is used first; otherwise `~/.tracker/federation.json`.

| Operation | Kind | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `federation_list` | question | tracked repos, χ, committed counts |
| `repo_sense` | question | what a repo is about, or a `purpose` search of it |
| `federation_ask` | question | one search across every tracked repo |
| `repo_drift` | action | recompute χ, record it, say whether the sense moved |
| `profile_show` | question | your accounts and the identity each host sees |
| `profile_repos` | question | every repo on every account, copies grouped |
| `sync_manifest` | question | a repo's origins and hide rules |
| `sync_visibility` | question | which origins may see given paths |
| `sync_status` | question | what a sync would pull and push (changes nothing) |
| `sync_run` | action | pull collaborators' commits, push each origin its view |
| `sync_message` | action | the message an origin sees for a mixed commit |
| `sync_resolve` | action | hand-resolve a blocked collaborator commit |
| `sync_hide` / `sync_unhide` | action | change what is hidden; commits `.sync.toml` |
| `sync_set_remote` | action | add or change an origin |

The error codes that ask the caller to act: `sync_conflict` and
`hidden_from_remote` → `sync_resolve`; `message_leak` → `sync_message`;
`purpose_missing` → install `purpose`; `no_federation` → `tracker init` somewhere
(e.g. in your home directory).

## You, across every forge: `tracker profile`

One profile for all your accounts, e.g. GitHub, gitlab.com, a company GitLab and a
university Gitea. It lives outside every repo (`~/.tracker/profile.toml`, or
`$TRACKER_PROFILE`) and holds **no secrets**. Credentials come from KeePassXC
through git's own credential protocol.

```toml
[identity]                      # you, on your canonical branches
name  = "Your Name"
email = "you@example.org"
also  = ["old@example.org"]     # further addresses that are also you

[accounts.work]
kind  = "gitlab"                # github | gitlab | gitea
host  = "gitlab.example-company.com"
user  = "you"
name  = "Your Name"             # how this host sees your commits
email = "you@example-company.com" # (default: [identity])
```

```bash
tracker profile init            # write a template
tracker profile show            # accounts, and who each host sees you as
tracker profile repos           # every repo on every account; copies grouped
tracker profile repos --json
tracker profile git-setup       # show the git config that hands credentials to KeePassXC
tracker profile git-setup --apply
```

**Per-host identity.** `tracker sync` gives your own commits the identity of the
account an origin belongs to: the Bitspark origin sees your Bitspark address, the
university sees your university address. Collaborators' commits keep their own
identities. Your edits made directly on a host come home under your canonical
identity. A manifest remote is matched to an account by host, or explicitly with
`account = "<id>"`.

**KeePassXC.** `git-setup --apply` does two things for each host. It asks
`keepassxc` first, keeping the previously configured helper (e.g. Git Credential
Manager) behind it as a fallback, so a host whose token is not in KeePassXC yet
keeps working (`--strict` drops the fallback). `keepassxc` is
[`git-credential-keepassxc`](https://github.com/Frederick888/git-credential-keepassxc)
asking your unlocked KeePassXC. And it adds an `includeIf` rule, so a repo whose
remote is on that host commits with that account's identity. In KeePassXC:

1. Settings → Browser Integration → enable it.
2. With the database unlocked, run once: `git-credential-keepassxc configure`.
3. One entry per host: URL `https://<host>`, the username, and a **personal access
   token** as the password. A login password works for git over HTTPS, but not for
   the APIs `profile repos` uses. Scopes: GitHub `repo`; GitLab `read_api`,
   `read_repository`, `write_repository`; Gitea `read:repository`,
   `write:repository`, `read:user`.

Tokens reach `curl` on stdin, never on a command line.

## Tokens that look after themselves: `tracker tokens`

Every account's token lives only in KeePassXC. tracker keeps track of each one:
- whether it still works;
- when it expires;
- whether it must be replaced.

It never opens the vault. It reaches a token through the paired helper, and
KeePassXC decides whether to answer. It holds the token in memory only for the
one API call that needs it, and writes a replacement back the same way. On disk it
keeps metadata only (`~/.tracker/tokens.json`: id, scopes, expiry, last check).

```bash
tracker tokens status            # every token: ok / expiring / missing / invalid, and expiry
tracker tokens set gitlab        # first time only: opens the page, paste the token, it goes to KeePassXC
tracker tokens refresh           # renew what is due now
tracker tokens schedule          # renew daily in the background (Task Scheduler / cron)
```

What each forge allows:

| Forge | Renewal |
|---|---|
| GitLab | **Automatic.** When a token has 14 days or fewer left, tracker rotates it through GitLab's own API. The new one (90-day lifetime) goes straight into KeePassXC, and GitLab revokes the old one. The token needs the `api` (or `self_rotate`) scope. |
| GitHub | No API can issue or rotate a token. Make a classic token with no expiry; tracker checks it still works. If you choose an expiring one, tracker reads its expiry date and warns ahead of it with the page to reissue it. |
| Gitea | No API can issue a token without your password, and Gitea tokens do not expire. tracker checks the token still works. |

A rotation first makes sure KeePassXC will accept a write. Only then does it ask
GitLab for the new token, so an old token is never revoked while the new one has
nowhere to go. If the write still fails, the new token is saved to
`~/.tracker/rescue-<account>.token` and the run fails loudly. The scheduled run
never waits for KeePassXC. If the vault is locked, it logs that to
`~/.tracker/tokens.log`, and the 14-day window leaves room to try again.

Agents get `tokens_status` and `tokens_refresh`. Neither ever returns a token.
`tokens set` is deliberately not exposed to agents, so raw tokens never pass
through an AI's context.

## One repo, several origins: `tracker sync`

For a repo that lives on several hosts (GitHub, gitlab.com, a company GitLab, a
university GitLab), where some work must stay off some of them.

One **canonical branch** holds everything; you work and commit there. Each origin
receives a **projection** of it: the same history with the paths hidden from that
origin filtered out. Collaborators commit to their origin as usual; their commits are
pulled back into the canonical branch and flow on to every other origin that may see
what they touched.

Visibility is declared in `.sync.toml`, committed on the canonical branch (and never
visible to any origin, since it names what is hidden):

```toml
branch = "main"

[remotes.github]
url  = "git@github.com:you/project.git"
sees = []                          # unlabelled paths only

[remotes.uni]
url  = "git@gitlab.uni-greifswald.de:you/project.git"
sees = ["uni"]

[remotes.bitspark]
url  = "git@gitlab.bitspark.de:you/project.git"
sees = ["uni", "bitspark"]

[hide]                             # glob = label; trailing "/" = whole directory
"bitspark/"      = "bitspark"
"notes/private/" = "private"       # no remote sees "private": it never leaves
```

A path is visible to an origin iff the origin `sees` every label whose glob matches
it. Globs match the full path from the repo root (`*` stays within one directory;
use `**/*.key` for "any depth").

```bash
tracker sync init                  # write a template .sync.toml; edit, then commit it
tracker sync status                # what would happen (fetches, changes nothing)
tracker sync run                   # pull collaborators' commits, push every projection
tracker sync run --remote uni      # just one origin
```

**What happens on `run`:**

- **Pull.** Each new commit on an origin is replayed onto the canonical branch with
  a three-way merge, so hidden files are carried through untouched. It keeps the
  collaborator's authorship and gains a `Sync-Origin: <remote> <sha>` trailer. That
  trailer stays in the canonical repo and is stripped from every projection.
- **Push.** Each origin gets its projection. Projection is deterministic and
  history only ever grows: no push is forced, and a collaborator's commit stays in
  their origin's history. A commit that touches only hidden paths simply doesn't
  appear there.

**Where it stops and asks you instead of guessing:**

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| A collaborator's commit conflicts with your canonical work | `tracker sync resolve <remote>`, fix, `git add`, `tracker sync resolve --continue` (or `--abort`) |
| A collaborator created a file in a path hidden from them | Same `resolve` flow, or change the manifest |
| One of your commits touches both visible and hidden paths, so its message may describe hidden work | `tracker sync message <commit> --remote uni "Extend the paper"` (or `--shared`); or set `mixed_messages = "generic"` / `"keep"` on that remote; or `--trust-messages` |
| An origin already had history this repo never pushed | Not supported yet (see limits below) |

**Guard.** `tracker sync run` installs a `pre-push` hook that refuses a direct
`git push` of the canonical branch to any origin in the manifest. If you already have
a pre-push hook, it is left alone and a warning is printed; add the guard to it by
hand.

**Keep with your private canonical remote.** Message overrides are git notes; push
them to wherever the canonical branch lives, with
`git push <private-remote> refs/notes/sync-messages`. The canonical→origin map in
`.git/tracker-sync/` is only a cache. On a fresh clone it is rebuilt by recognising
the earlier projections.

**Current limits:**

- Hiding is by whole path; parts of a shared file cannot be hidden.
- An origin whose existing history was not produced by `tracker sync` cannot be
  adopted yet. Start it from an empty branch.
- A collaborator's merge is taken in as one commit, credited to whoever made the
  merge.
- A collaborator force-pushing over history already synced is not handled.
- Once pushed, history is permanent. Tightening the manifest hides paths from the
  next commit on; it cannot recall anything already pushed.

## The website: `tracker graph` and `tracker serve`

The site (`thrust/`, on Vercel) shows your repos, but everything it shows lives on
your machine — the repos, the forge tokens in KeePassXC, the Ollama model. So the
browser talks to a local engine:

```bash
tracker graph build                      # every git repo under ~/Documents → one knowledge graph
tracker graph build --generator ollama   # richer facets; minutes instead of seconds
tracker serve                            # the engine, on 127.0.0.1:8734
```

`graph build` writes each repo as a *card* — README opening, manifest descriptions,
folder names, languages, but not its name — and lets `okgg` individuate the cards
into facets and values, each triple backed by a cue word. The result, joined with git
facts (remotes, hosts, last commit), goes to `~/.tracker/graph/federation.json`, and
every repo found is registered in the home federation so it can be named in `repo`
arguments. Nothing about your repos is written into the site's repository.

`serve` prints a pairing link (`…/tracker#pair=<token>`); open it once per browser.
The engine answers only:

* on the loopback address, with a matching `Host` header (no DNS rebinding);
* to the site's origins — defaults plus `~/.tracker/serve.toml` (`origins = [...]`,
  `site = "..."`, `port = ...`) and `--origin` flags;
* to a browser holding the pairing token (`~/.tracker/serve.token`; `--new-token`
  unpairs every browser). Only `/health` is open.

Questions run directly (`POST /call/{op}`). Actions never do: `POST /propose` keeps
one, and it runs only on `POST /confirm/{id}`. The site's pages:

| Page | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Repo Lens → Federation graph** | D3 force graph of repos and okgg values (hover an edge for its cue), similarity view, facet filters, charts by facet/forge/area/language/activity, the okgg V trajectory |
| **Code** | any repo as on a forge: file tree at any branch, history, diffs; edit, create and delete files, commit (optionally on a new branch), push to a chosen origin, open a Codespace |
| **Tracker** | a chat with the local Ollama model, which uses tracker's operations as tools and answers with charts; anything that changes a repo comes back as a card you confirm. Left: repos by last commit; right: repos you looked at |

The chat model defaults to `llama3.2` (`TRACKER_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_HOST` override).
On a CPU-only machine the first answer after a start is slow; `serve` warms the model
in the background, and a question stops starting new model rounds after 150 s,
returning what it found.

The site itself is behind a password: set `SITE_PASSWORD` and `AUTH_SECRET` (any
long random string) on the Vercel project. Without both, a deployment is locked
(503); `next dev` runs open.

## Design invariants it honours

From the split-attention-agents blueprint (each a checkable predicate):

- **I1 — conserved identity:** χ is a weighted-graph invariant, unchanged under
  relabelling. *(tested)*
- **I2 — never-resetting count:** each tracked act (index, χ recompute, run)
  increments a monotone counter `m`; nothing decrements it. *(tested)*
- **I3 — search-not-fetch:** every `sense`/`ask` answer comes from a fresh
  `purpose ask` against the current index, never a stored value.
- **I4 — exclusive phases:** constructing (re-indexing / recomputing χ) and
  committing (answering) never share an instant.

## Status

Working: `init`, `add`, `list`, `sense`, `ask`, `drift`. `run` is stubbed with
graceful degradation pending the network-yield CLI interface. Federation-level χ(Σ)
(the group's own direction) is the next milestone.
